- This configuration expects `vim` to be installed. If you are using `nvim` instead make sure to make adjustments to both the *shell editor* as well as the *manpager*. 

- If you plan to use the starship prompt, this config will tell starship to look for its configuration file at `$HOME/.config/starship/starship.toml`.
